# Custom-Random-Number-Generator-in-C++

This project implements a custom **pseudo-random number generator (PRNG)** using a **Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)** formula. It simulates dice rolls and allows the user to specify the number of rolls.  

 ðŸ“Œ Features
- Uses a **custom PRNG** instead of `rand()`.
- Seeding with `time(0)` for better randomness.
- Simulates dice rolls with a frequency counter.
- Runs in a loop for continuous testing.

ðŸ›  Future Improvements
Use std::random_device for better randomness.
Implement a more advanced PRNG algorithm.
Add a graphical visualization of dice rolls.
